modules:
  if_mib:  # The module name. You can have as many modules as you want.
    walk:       # List of OIDs to walk. Can also be SNMP object names or specific instances.
      - 1.3.6.1.2.1.2

    version: 2  # SNMP version to use. Defaults to 2.
                # 1 will use GETNEXT, 2 and 3 use GETBULK.
    max_repetitions: 25  # How many objects to request with GET/GETBULK, defaults to 25.
                         # May need to be reduced for buggy devices.
    retries: 3   # How many times to retry a failed request, defaults to 3.
    timeout: 10s  # Timeout for each individual SNMP request, defaults to 5s.

    auth:
      # Community string is used with SNMP v1 and v2. Defaults to "public".

    lookups:  # Optional list of lookups to perform.
              # The default for `keep_source_indexes` is false. Indexes must be unique for this option to be used.

      # If the index of a table is bsnDot11EssIndex, usually that'd be the label
      # on the resulting metrics from that table. Instead, use the index to
      # lookup the bsnDot11EssSsid table entry and create a bsnDot11EssSsid label
      # with that value.
      - source_indexes: [bsnDot11EssIndex]
        lookup: bsnDot11EssSsid
        drop_source_indexes: false  # If true, delete source index labels for this lookup.
                                    # This avoids label clutter when the new index is unique.

      # It is also possible to chain lookups or use multiple labels to gather label values.
      # This might be helpful to resolve multiple index labels to a proper human readable label.
      # Please be aware that ordering matters here.

      # In this example, we first do a lookup to get the `cbQosConfigIndex` as another label.
      - source_indexes: [cbQosPolicyIndex, cbQosObjectsIndex]
        lookup: cbQosConfigIndex
      # Using the newly added label, we have another lookup to fetch the `cbQosCMName` based on `cbQosConfigIndex`.
      - source_indexes: [cbQosConfigIndex]
        lookup: cbQosCMName
